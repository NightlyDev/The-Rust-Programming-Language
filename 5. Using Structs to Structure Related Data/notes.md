## Notes for 5. Using Structs to Strucuture Related Data

- structs remind me of javascripts way of creating classes:
  - key: value, seperated by commas
- mutable structs need to be declared completed mutable, single attributes can not be declared as mutable
- .. (dot dot) syntax allows for copying from other structs
- values need to be declared as lifetime parameters. Therefore references won't work out of the box.
