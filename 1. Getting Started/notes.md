## Notes for 1. Getting Started

- compiling with `rustc [filename]`
- main-function similar to other programming languages like C++ and C
- Rust own automatic formatter tool called `rustfmt [filename]` is very helpful
- a function ending with `!` is called *macro*. Will be discussed later in chapter 19.
